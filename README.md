# tempo-edf-raspberry-pi-led

A simple multi langage raspberry pi set of tools to run on you raspberry pi to show a RGB led color of the day

## Why

Because on red days we pay 3x the classical pricing so we need to know it by showing a red light

## Project

This project was a POC and work with a :

- Rasperry pi 3 A+ model
- [A kit of many things](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0BJF6TZJX?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) (gpio board / wire / RGB led / a resitance of 320Ω)

## Langage

I wanted to have this project in multi lang

- Typescript because that's my favorite langage
- Rust because i love to hate him
- Go, to compare simplicity with Rust
- Zig, really want to try it, due to bun use it and retro-compatibility with C/C++
- C++ because after working on Rust, I think this old one is better

  If you see thing badly wrote, don't hesitate to PR or issue me!

## Schema

I used a brown wire for ground connected to N°6 entry based on this
